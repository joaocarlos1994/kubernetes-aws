Kubernetes ReplicaSets

A ReplicaSet’s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As 
such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

A ReplicaSet is defined with fields, including a selector that specifies how to identify Pods it can
acquire, a number of replicas indicating how many Pods it should be maintaining, and a pod
template specifying the data of new Pods it should create to meet the number of replicas
criteria. A ReplicaSet then fulfills its purpose by creating and deleting Pods as needed to reach
the desired number. When a ReplicaSet needs to create new Pods, it uses its Pod template.

Therefore, we recommend using Deployments instead of directly using ReplicaSets, unless you require 
custom update orchestration or don’t require updates at all.


Some utils commands:

    - kubectl describe rs webapp
      This command is used to describe a specfic ReplicaSet using "rs"
