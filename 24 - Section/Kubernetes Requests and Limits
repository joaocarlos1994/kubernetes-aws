Kubernetes Requests and Limits

To get all node from Cluster use the following command:

    kubectl get nodes

For retrieve information about the a specific node use the following command:

    kubectl describe node minikube

The motivation of request and limits is if your namespace has a resource quota, 
it is helpful to have a default value in place for memory limit. Here are two of the 
restrictions that a resource quota imposes on a namespace:

    - Every Container that runs in the namespace must have its own memory limit.

    - The total amount of memory used by all Containers in the namespace must not exceed a 
    specified limit.

The specification of request and limits following the pattern below:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: default-mem-demo-2
spec:
  containers:
  - name: default-mem-demo-2-ctr
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "0.1m"  
      limits:
        memory: "1Gi"
        cpu: "0.2m"

If a Container does not specify its own memory limit, it is given the default limit, and then it 
can be allowed to run in a namespace that is restricted by a quota.
