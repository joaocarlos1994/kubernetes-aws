Kubernetes Pods

A Pod is the basic execution unit of a Kubernetes application–the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. A Pod represents processes running on your cluster.

A Pod encapsulates an application’s container (or, in some cases, multiple containers), storage resources, a unique network identity (IP address), as well as options that govern how the container(s) should run. A Pod represents a unit of deployment: a single instance of an application in Kubernetes, which might consist of either a single container or a small number of containers that are tightly coupled and that share resources.
