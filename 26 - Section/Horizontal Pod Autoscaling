HPA - Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler automatically scales the number of Pods in a replication controller, 
deployment, replica set or stateful set based on observed CPU utilization (or, with custom metrics 
support, on some other application-provided metrics). Note that Horizontal Pod Autoscaling does not 
apply to objects that can't be scaled, for example, DaemonSets.

The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller. The 
resource determines the behavior of the controller. The controller periodically adjusts the number 
of replicas in a replication controller or deployment to match the observed average CPU utilization 
to the target specified by user.
