Quality of Service and Eviction

When Kubernetes creates a Pod it assigns one of these QoS classes to the Pod:

    - Guaranteed
    - Burstable
    - BestEffort

For a Pod to be given a QoS class of Guaranteed:

    - Every Container in the Pod must have a memory limit and a memory request, and they must be 
      the same.

    - Every Container in the Pod must have a CPU limit and a CPU request, and they must be the same.



Pod Priority and Preemption

Pods can have priority. Priority indicates the importance of a Pod relative to other Pods. If a Pod 
cannot be scheduled, the scheduler tries to preempt (evict) lower priority Pods to make scheduling of 
the pending Pod possible.


    apiVersion: scheduling.k8s.io/v1
    kind: PriorityClass
    metadata:
        name: high-priority
    value: 1000000
    globalDefault: false
    description: "This priority class should be used for XYZ service pods only."
