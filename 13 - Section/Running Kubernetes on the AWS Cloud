Running Kubernetes on the AWS Cloud

This section is an description about Kops e EKS Cluster on AWS. The main diference about 
this two option  is that EKS doesn't have a main node wherease Kops used to have main
node to manager.

Using the EKS the main node is manager by AWS, and some os the benefit is the auto-scaling of
main node.
