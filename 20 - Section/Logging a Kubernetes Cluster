Logging a Kubernetes Cluster

DaemonSet

    A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added to the 
    cluster, Pods are added to them. As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage 
    collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

    Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:

        - running a cluster storage daemon on every node
        - running a logs collection daemon on every node
        - running a node monitoring daemon on every node


StatefulSets

    StatefulSet is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.

    Manages the deployment and scaling of a set of Pods, and provides guarantees about the 
    ordering and uniqueness of these Pods.

    Like a Deployment, a StatefulSet manages Pods that are based on an identical container spec. 
    Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of their Pods. These 
    pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable: each has a persistent 
    identifier that it maintains across any rescheduling.

    If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a 
    StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible 
    to failure, the persistent Pod identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new 
    Pods that replace any that have failed.
