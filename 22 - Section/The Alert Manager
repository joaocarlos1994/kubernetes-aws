The Alert Manager could be a feature pre-configured with Prometheus and Grafana
instalation using Helm package.

In this example using Helm package to install Prometheus and Grafana it was install
an specific Alert Manager that you can access this resource on AWS infrastructure.

To save some money you don't need to create a load balance to access Alert Manager interface,
you can visit this page through Kubernet service using the proxy configuration.

The first step to access a services without using a load balance you need to logon
on browser as Kubernet's Adminstrator, to get this password run the following command:

    kubectl config view --minify

After you get your Kubernets Adminstrator password you need to log in and access
the desired api for example:

    LOAD_BALANCE_URI/api/v1/namespaces/monitoring/services/alertmanager-operated:9093/proxy/#/alerts

Using the above URL you're accesing the service outside the cluster, without using a load balance.
